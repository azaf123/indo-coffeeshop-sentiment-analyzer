I am a coffee drinker however mostly never wanted to try a new place due to some people just couldn't listen to my preference.

If you love coffee and want to drink the best coffee in the world and learn about coffee, go to Seniman.
Here you can taste all the different coffees, experience the flavour profiles, and learn all about production and brewing methods.
The breakfast is great and if you like smashed avocado on sourdough and you thought only Melbourne could do it right; this place puts Melbourne to shame. Breakfast is delicious here.
The atmosphere is trendy and clever. For example: they have converted flimsy plastic deck chairs into solid comfortable rocking chairs with a very simple modification.
